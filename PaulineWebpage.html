		<u>2. E-Business website review </u>
	</h2>
	<p>
	<pre>
	I chose to analyze the Zara website. You can find the link of the website <a href="https://www.zara.com/kr/" target="_blank">here</a>.

	<a href="#disadvantages">3. Disadvantages </a>
	</b>
	<ul>
		<li style="font-family: Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'">1. Presentation </li>
			<a id="presentation"></a>
			Zara is an international clothing brand of Spanish origin. 
			The website has a business model, so it is a "virtual storefront".
			The target audience is a mixed clientele, mostly between 18 and 40 years old. 
			The website is thus expected to be intuitive and aimed at a young audience. 
			This is what we are going to analyze.
			The Inditex group, which owns Zara, makes about 10% of its sales online (2018 data).
		<li style="font-family: Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'">2. Advantages </li>
			<a id="advantages"></a>
			The website seems to be available on several browsers, and also on iPhone. (However we will see that there are
			some disadvantages about it)
			When we arrive on the first page, the site asks in which country are we, which enables to not support language barriers.
			On the other hand, when you resize the page, it adapts.
			It is visible to search engines and everything is labelled correctly. 
			
			<img src="exemple2.png" alt="Zara on a search engine" height="300px">

			But the aesthetic of the website is minimalist and rather pretty.
			Also, we can easily find information about the brand :
			
			<img src="Example5.png" alt="Information and about us" height="300px">
			
		<li style="font-family: Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'">3. Disadvantages </li>
			<a id="disadvantages"></a>
			The usability is one of the main disadvantages of the website.
			The links to the different pages of the site are not very distinctive.
			Indeed, they are at the bottom of the page, written very small and on a background image that makes them even less visible.
			It's the same thing for the search bar, which we see very little depending on the background image.
			You can see on the image below : 
			
			<img src="exemple.png" alt="Home Page of Zara" height="300px">
			
			Besides, the display of the different clothes is not very intuitive. 
			Indeed, even if it is possible to adjust the number of clothes displayed per row, the initial format is intended to be minimalist and aesthetic, 
			but eventually it complicates the navigation.
			It gives this:
			
			<img src="example3.png" alt="Example 3 of Navigation" height="300px">
			
			Even if we can switch to this : 
			
			<img src="example4.png" alt="Example of Navigation with 4 clothes on a row" height="300px">
			
			
			Moreover the navigation is not very simple and very sensitive, as soon as the cursor passes over a product, it struggles to change the image and it is slightly buggy.
			The clothes are presented in an aesthetic even in an upscale way, so sometimes in my opinion it does not fit perfectly with the customer base. 
			Indeed, Zara is a fast fashion brand and I think the website should be more appropriate, with direct views and glimpses on the clothes.
			<b>
			I think that the Zara website should be redesigned to make it simpler, without taking away from the aesthetics. 
			It would even win over an older clientele not used to e-commerce.
